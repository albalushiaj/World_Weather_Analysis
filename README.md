# World_Weather_Analysis
## Project Overview
- To create a Python script for the PlanMyTrip app which is a traveling application that helps customers plan trips with curtain criteria in mind. 
- Adding the weather description to the weather data youâ€™ve already retrieved in creating this app. Then, you'll have the beta testers use input statements to filter the data for their weather preferences, which will be used to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. From the list of potential travel destinations, the beta tester will choose four cities to create a travel itinerary. Finally, using the Google Maps Directions API, you will create a travel route between the four cities as well as a marker layer map.
## Country and cities for this Itinerary
This  hypothetical vacation trip is in Japan where the customer visits the following cities:
1. Tottori
2.  Nara 
3. Shingu
